如你所见，没什么好说的，如果使用出现乱码，修改区域和语言为utf8就可以了(我懒得编译gbk版本你可以自己编译)
如果遇到问题请提交lssue
我刚开始学习c++，哪里写的不好请直说
想添加gui，在学了

As you can see, there's nothing to say. If there are garbled characters when using it, just modify the region and language to utf8 (I'm too lazy to compile the GBK version, you can compile it yourself)
If you encounter any problems, please submit lssue
I just started learning C++, please let me know where I'm not good at
I want to add GUI, and I am currently learning
